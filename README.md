A full-stack live chat application that I created using React for the front-end, as well as NodeJS and SocketIO to handle communications for the back-end. Users and rooms are tracked with their IDs in the back-end, and there are SYSTEM notifications that let users in the chat know when someone new has joined the room as well as whenever someone leaves. Implements auto-scrolling whenever a new message is sent. Front-end deployed on Netlify and back-end deployed on Heroku. Check it out here: https://jamalkhadir-chatapp.netlify.app
