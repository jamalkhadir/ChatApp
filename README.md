A full-stack live chat application that I created using React for the front-end, as well as NodeJS and SocketIO for the back-end. Users and rooms are tracked with their IDs in the back-end, and there are SYSTEM notifications that are displayed to users in the room when a new user has joined and also when they leave. Other front-end components include the styling of the chat being developed to mimic a traditional message application to be more intuitive to users, including the distinguishing of whether the message in the chat was sent by you or someone else using conventional message positioning (a message on the left side being sent by other users, while messages on the right side being sent by you) as well as conventional message coloring (a white-background message was sent other users while a blue-background message was sent by you). Front-end deployed on Netlify and back-end deployed on Heroku. Check it out here: https://jamalkhadir-chatapp.netlify.app
