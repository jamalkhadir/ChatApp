A full-stack live chat application that I created using React for the front-end, as well as NodeJS and SocketIO for the back-end. Users and rooms are tracked with their IDs in the back-end, and there are SYSTEM notifications that are displayed to current users in the room when a new users join and leave. Other front-end components include the styling of the chat being developed to mimic a traditional message application to be more intuitive to users, including the distinguishing of whether the message in the chat was sent by you or someone else using conventional message positioning (messages on the left side were sent by other users, while messages on the right side were sent by you) as well as conventional message coloring (white-background messages were sent by other users while blue-background messages were sent by you). Front-end deployed on Netlify and back-end deployed on Heroku. Check it out here: https://jamalkhadir-chatapp.netlify.app
